## Technical Information

The bot is built with modern technologies for reliability and performance:

### Core Technologies
- **Node.js & Discord.js v14**: Latest Discord API features and optimizations
- **Custom Server-Based Sharding**: One shard per server for improved reliability and resource isolation
- **SQLite Database**: Efficient and reliable data storage with automated backups
- **Custom Embed Builder**: Professional and consistent message formatting
- **Winston Logger**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and monitoring

### Recent Improvements
- **Server-Based Sharding**: Implemented custom one-shard-per-server approach for better resource allocation

- **API Compatibility**: Updated to latest Discord.js interaction patterns
- **Deprecation Fixes**: Replaced deprecated API calls with current standards
- **Robust Error Handling**: Improved error recovery and exception management

### Data Security
- **Automated Backups**: Regular database backups performed every 24 hours
- **Safe Deepmerge Implementation**: Prevents stack overflow with circular references
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all user inputs
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API errors and rate limits

## Deployment

The bot is hosted on Replit for 24/7 uptime with automated monitoring and restart capabilities.

## Sharding

This bot implements three different sharding modes:

### 1. Standalone Mode (No Sharding)
For small deployments with few servers, the bot can run without sharding. This is the default mode.

### 2. Standard Discord.js Sharding
For medium-sized deployments, the bot can use Discord.js's built-in sharding manager which distributes guilds across shards based on guild ID.

### 3. Server-Based Sharding
For optimal performance and reliability, the bot implements a custom "one shard per server" approach:
- Each Discord server gets its own dedicated shard
- Complete resource isolation between servers
- Enhanced error containment (issues in one server won't affect others)
- Improved ability to handle server-specific load patterns

See [SHARDING.md](SHARDING.md) for detailed documentation on the server-based sharding implementation.
